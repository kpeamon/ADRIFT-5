# ADRIFT-5
Modified ADRIFT 5 library files:
1. Danish Standard Library V3
2. Manual for Danish Standard Library
3. Improved Time system for ADRIFT 5

Currently planned:
* Eamon Revived - An Eamon anthology with several adventures connected through the Main Hall so weapons, armor etc. can be brought from one adventure to the other. The applied combat formulas will be much closer to the original and thus more action.
* Danish Time Module
* Danish Money Module
