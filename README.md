# ADRIFT-5
Library files and other stuff related to ADRIFT 5 (an interactive fiction tool for writing text adventures):
1. Combined Library Release 4.3 (English improved Standard Library)
2. Danish Standard Library V4
3. Manual for Danish Standard Library
4. Improved Time system for ADRIFT 5
5. Two-word parser library (The Verb-Noun Library)

Currently planned:
* Eamon IF - An Eamon anthology with several adventures connected through the Main Hall so weapons, armor etc. can be brought from one adventure to the other. The applied combat formulas will be much closer to the original and thus more action. Everything is done in ADRIFT 5.
* Danish Time Module
* Danish Money Module
